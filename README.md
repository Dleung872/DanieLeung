When performing division, remainders can be requested as well as how many decimals places are needed. This program exists because it was a past assignment i did in my computer programming class. The tools used for this project were: my computer and visual studiocode.

## How to run
#### Click on the run button, the program will ask for 2 numbers, once inputted, pick your operator of choice (+,-,*,/,**)to get a final answer. If / is inputted the program will ask if the user wants remainders or not, if yes, the final answer will output as NrN, if no, the user will then be asked for decimal places, if yes, the user will be againsed ask for the amount of decimal places to be rounded to, and if no, floor division will be performed.
